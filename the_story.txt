Once upon a time


The meanest professor ever insisted his class learn to use GIT as a practical tool of collaborative software development
He decided the class lacked the necessary GIT kung fu skills; so he made them keep redoing the GIT exercise EVERY WEEK until the 60 students were capable of successful collaboration.
The mean professor summoned a wizard with a pet dragon.
The dragon was a beautiful beast and had an addiction to Big Macs.
The wizard rode his pet dragon off into the distance.
(But it wasn't really a dragon; it was Linus Torvald, who, of course, is a shape-shifter.)
To the mystical land of git-a-nova, to meet the git master Gitzilla.
The Gitzilla agrees to turn him into a git master.
The inexperienced student began honing his git kung fu skills
He would not rest until he had mastered the ways of git
He fought Git Almas, the Git Beast of Dartmoor, and even the Git Brosno Dragon.
Then the professor said "Git out of here you silly programmers!"
Everyone ruined their weekend by learning to Git better at collaboration
Except for the mythical eastern cougar named Sami, she loved Git more than anything in the entire world.
However, Sami's love of git drove her insane.
So insane, infact, she tried to befriend the Ahool.
The Ahool hooted praise to the wizard for his new Git knowledge.
The Bear Lake Monster splashed his fins in agreement.
He then used the other fin to hit the nae nae.
However, the village people were not amused.
Bigfoot couldn't stop talking about how he likes to push and bash.
But then comes along the Devil Bird and says lets git down to business
Then Bigfoot and the Devil Bird start singing "Let it go" from Frozen.
But Linus brashly tells them to shut up (in typical Linus fashion).
Upset at the intrusion, Bigfoot threw a Sea Serpent at Linus.
Linus's love of C protected him from the Python attack.  He retorted by calling Bigfoot a Skunk Ape.
The Como Lake Monster appeared suddenly bearing cannolis.
Unfortunately, they were soggy since he lives in a lake......duh.
The fire ninja called his master.
His master arrived on the mystical cloud.
Sensi SSH warned his protege about summoning him without his keys.
However the ninja begged his sensi to toast his cannolis.
Sensi SSH unfortunately responded "ssh: Could not resolve toast."
The ninja realized the error of his ways and new that he needed his keys to toast those cannolis.
The Kraken waited in the sea for a large boat to come by that it could destroy.
The Missouri Monster, Momo, would destroy the Jayhawk's pride.
The cannolis then turned into Beast of Dean from the toast.
Boy was the ninja terrified.Momo then went after the Beast of Dean for a final showdown
Before they could start, the evil professor jumped in
the ninja came, if i spelled correctly.
killed a ninja. if already exists one. 
Linus Torvald was a mothman.
A ninja killed another ninja.

The end.
