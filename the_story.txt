Once upon a time


The meanest professor ever insisted his class learn to use GIT as a practical tool of collaborative software development
He decided the class lacked the necessary GIT kung fu skills; so he made them keep redoing the GIT exercise EVERY WEEK until the 60 students were capable of successful collaboration.
The mean professor summoned a wizard with a pet dragon.
The wizard rode his pet dragon off into the distance.

The end.
