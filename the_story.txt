Once upon a time


The meanest professor ever insisted his class learn to use GIT as a practical tool of collaborative software development
He decided the class lacked the necessary GIT kung fu skills; so he made them keep redoing the GIT exercise EVERY WEEK until the 60 students were capable of successful collaboration.
The mean professor summoned a wizard with a pet dragon.
The dragon was a beautiful beast and had an addiction to Big Macs.
The wizard rode his pet dragon off into the distance.
(But it wasn't really a dragon; it was Linus Torvald, who, of course, is a shape-shifter.)
To the mystical land of git-a-nova, to meet the git master Gitzilla.
The Gitzilla agrees to turn him into a git master.
The inexperienced student began honing his git kung fu skills
He would not rest until he had mastered the ways of git
He fought Git Almas, the Git Beast of Dartmoor, and even the Git Brosno Dragon.
Then the professor said "Git out of here you silly programmers!"
Everyone ruined their weekend by learning to Git better at collaboration
Except for the mythical eastern cougar named Sami, she loved Git more than anything in the entire world.
The Ahool hooted praise to the wizard for his new Git knowledge.
The Bear Lake Monster splashed his fins in agreement.

The end.
