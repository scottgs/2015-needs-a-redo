Once upon a time


The meanest professor ever insisted his class learn to use GIT as a practical tool of collaborative software development
He decided the class lacked the necessary GIT kung fu skills; so he made them keep redoing the GIT exercise EVERY WEEK until the 60 students were capable of successful collaboration.
The mean professor summoned a wizard with a pet dragon.
The wizard rode his pet dragon off into the distance.
The inexperienced student began honing his git kung fu skills
He would not rest until he had mastered the ways of git

The end.
